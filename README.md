# P2P
It's going to be a P2P bot for working with multiple people. (non malicious) Coded in Python


I'm working on improving my Python skills. The ideal for the program is not how botnets today use Peer 2 Peer for malicous intent, but rather for companies to use it to: monitior work computers, IT can manage files on systems and make changes without manually having to connect to every system. Granted it doesn't have to be P2P, but I'm wanting to practice this method.

Thanks for anyone who wants to help, it should be a fun project.
